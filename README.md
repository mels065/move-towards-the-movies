# Move Towards the Movies
 
Move Towards the Movies is a web app that fetches movie data from the GraceNote Movie API based on the zipcode and displays all movies playing in the area. The user can then click a movie and see details on the movie, showtimes, and an image fetched from TMDB API. Our goal was to create a website that was able to show the theater nearest to the user for the movie that they want to see.
